### Core Components

#### 1. DailyQuizComposerService

**Main orchestrator service** - `daily-quiz-composer.service.ts`

- Coordinates all sub-services in proper sequence
- Creates database records (DailyQuiz, DailyQuizQuestion) in transactions
- Generates comprehensive composition logs with performance metrics
- Handles automatic theme plan generation based on mode and date
- Implements robust error handling with detailed error logs
- Manages CDN URL generation and template versioning
- Updates question usage tracking atomically

**Key Methods:**

- `composeDailyQuiz()` - Main entry point for quiz composition
- `generateThemePlan()` - Auto-generates themes based on mode/date
- `buildCompositionLog()` - Creates detailed logs for monitoring

#### 2. QuestionSelectorService

**Intelligent question selection with progressive relaxation** - `question-selector.service.ts`

- Implements complete `pickWithRelaxation()` algorithm as specified
- Manages theme and subject diversity with configurable thresholds
- Applies exposure bias (strongly prefers less-used questions)
- Advanced fallback strategies for insufficient question scenarios
- Database-optimized queries using existing indexes
- Real-time availability statistics for monitoring

**Progressive Selection Algorithm:**

1. Try strict 30-day anti-repeat with exposure bias
2. Progressively relax to 21→14→10→7 days
3. Apply theme and subject diversity filtering
4. Emergency fallback for critical shortages
5. Update usage tracking atomically

#### 3. AntiRepeatService

**Progressive relaxation anti-repeat logic** - `anti-repeat.service.ts`

- **30 days (Level 0):** Strict anti-repeat, no questions used in last 30 days + exposure bias
- **21 days (Level 1):** Relaxed level 1, minimal repeats allowed
- **14 days (Level 2):** Relaxed level 2, some repeats allowed
- **10 days (Level 3):** Relaxed level 3, more repeats allowed
- **7 days (Level 4):** Final relaxation, any question allowed
- **Emergency:** Least recently used questions as absolute fallback

**Key Features:**

- Database-optimized queries with proper indexing
- Exposure count tracking and bias application
- Availability statistics for all relaxation levels
- Atomic usage updates with timestamp tracking

#### 4. DifficultyDistributionService

**Ensures perfect difficulty balance** - `difficulty-distribution.service.ts`

- **Primary Target:** 3 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard (total 6 questions)
- **Adaptive Scaling:** Proportional distribution for different quiz sizes
- **Intelligent Fallbacks:** Redistribution when target can't be met
- **Emergency Mode:** Minimum viable quiz with any available questions
- **Validation:** Pre-composition feasibility checks

**Fallback Strategy:**

1. Use available questions at each difficulty level
2. Redistribute deficit to other difficulties (Easy → Medium → Hard priority)
3. Emergency distribution when total questions < 3
4. Comprehensive logging of all adjustments made

#### 5. TemplateService

**Production-ready CDN template generation** - `template.service.ts`

- **Security:** Completely strips all answer data for client consumption
- **Performance:** Optimized JSON structure for fast parsing
- **Versioning:** Proper cache busting with version increments
- **CDN Integration:** Ready for S3/CloudFront deployment
- **Media Handling:** Converts internal paths to CDN URLs
- **Validation:** Template structure verification before deployment

**Template Features:**

- Answer-free question data for client consumption
- Consistent question ordering (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- Metadata including theme/difficulty breakdowns
- Size optimization and structure validation
- Ready for immediate CDN upload
